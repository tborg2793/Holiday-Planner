# Holiday-Planner

This project involves implementing a web application used to plan a holiday
abroad with a number of people. The goal is to develop a self-contained
application with features that allow a user to rent out apartments, add attractions,
find the directions to these attractions and the way an end user should visit these
attractions once and only once utilizing a genetic algorithm utilizing crossover and
mutation methods. The genetic algorithm gave positive results when compared to
existing algorithms available for different applications.

Upon completion of all these objectives, it becomes clear from the evaluation
techniques that users prefer having an application by which planning could be
done in a simpler way. The participants walked away from the program with a
sense of hope that they will be able to utilize this program in the near future. 

Usage of Google Maps API, Google Places API, a self programmed genetic algorithm and a payment gateway example using Paypal API and sandbox.
